###Intermediate implementation of prototype 1###

It doesn't work on the site yet, only in command line.
Make sure you have sympy installed, otherwise it won't work.

The way to use it is:

    - Run Factory.py and enter the equation to solve.
    - You can then enter the steps of the resolution one by one (press enter between each step)

It is still a little buggy so you may find some bugs but don't worry, we are aware of them (well at least most of them).
It works only for integers (at the moment).

The code is in this zip file and also at this adress : https://github.com/algerlache/oscareducation/tree/dev/promotions (you will need Factory.py and InputHandler.py to make it run)
